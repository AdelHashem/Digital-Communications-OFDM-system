# Digital-Communications-OFDM-system
In the Digital Communications project, you will investigate the performance of an OFDM-based  communication system

## Channel coding:
- [X] PolarCode
- [x] LinearBlock (the Decoder (Matlab Fun))
## Symbol mapper:
- [x] QPSK
- [ ] 16QAM
- [ ] 64QAM
## Pilot:
- [x] implemented (Not Sure)
## Cyclic prefix
- [x] Add Cyclic prefix
- [x] Remove Cyclic prefix
## channel
- [x] AWGN
- [x] Multi-path fading 
## MIMO setups:
- [X] SISO (QPSK-LinearBlock)
- [ ] SIMO
